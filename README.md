This is useful if you have any arbitrary need for chroots.

This might be also useful for building Gentoo's `binpkgs` if you have a number of similar systems and need similar `binpkgs` for them, you could build them in a chroot on a powerful/efficient/whatever-that-is system and then distribute amongst target systems. Alternatively you might have a powerful system, that could build various (different `march`, `arch` etc.) `binpkgs` for other systems.

To get started, read the [Documentation](https://pf4public.github.io/gb-chroot/).
